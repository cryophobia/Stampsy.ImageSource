Stampsy.ImageSource
===================

A MonoTouch library to fetch images from Asset Library or Dropbox, scale them down and efficiently save them to disk.  
This one is in early stages, the docs are coming later.

This library needs [rx-monotouch](https://github.com/stampsy/rx-monotouch) in the same solution to compile.  
I haven't tested it on Mono 3 yet.
